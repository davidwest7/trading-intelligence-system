## 🔧 **CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX**

### **1. Opportunity Store Bug**
```python
# Issue: ticker field mapping error in get_top_opportunities
assert top_opportunities[0].ticker == "AAPL"  # Fails
# Actual: top_opportunities[0].ticker == "test_001"
```

### **2. Value Agent Method Mismatches**
```python
# Issue: Test expects private methods that don't exist
agent._get_financial_data()  # Method doesn't exist
agent._calculate_fair_value()  # Method doesn't exist
agent._calculate_margin_of_safety()  # Method doesn't exist
```

### **3. Data Structure Mismatches**
```python
# Issue: Test expects different result structure
assert 'analysis_summary' in result['undervalued_analysis']  # Key doesn't exist
assert 'success' in result['undervalued_analysis']  # Key doesn't exist
```

### **4. Scoring Algorithm Issues**
```python
# Issue: High value opportunity scoring too low
score = scorer.calculate_priority_score(high_value_opp)
assert score > 0.5  # Fails with 0.406
```

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

### **1. Fix Opportunity Store Bug**
```python
# In common/opportunity_store.py, line 271
# Change:
opp = Opportunity(
    id=row[0],  # This is wrong
    ticker=row[0],  # This should be row[1]
    # ...
)
# To:
opp = Opportunity(
    id=row[0],
    ticker=row[1],  # Fix ticker field
    # ...
)
```

### **2. Update Value Agent Tests**
```python
# Remove tests for non-existent private methods
# Focus on testing the public process() method
# Update expected result structure
```

### **3. Fix Scoring Algorithm**
```python
# Adjust weights in UnifiedOpportunityScorer
# Ensure high-value opportunities get higher scores
```

### **4. Add Missing Test Coverage**
```python
# Add tests for:
# - Main API endpoints
# - Streamlit dashboard components
# - Agent integration
# - Error handling scenarios
```
