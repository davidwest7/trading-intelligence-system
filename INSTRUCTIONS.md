# 🚀 Trading Intelligence Dashboard Instructions

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Directory Navigation

You MUST run commands from the project directory, not your home directory!

### 🔧 Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd /Users/davidwestera/trading-intelligence-system
```

### 🌐 Step 2: Launch Enhanced Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_enhanced.py --server.port=8501
```

### 📊 Step 3: See Opportunities in Dashboard

1. **Open Dashboard**: Visit http://localhost:8501
2. **Run Analysis**: 
   - Select "Value Analysis" from sidebar
   - Choose multiple symbols (e.g., BRK.B, JPM, XOM)
   - Click "🚀 Run Analysis"
3. **View Opportunities**:
   - Wait for analysis to complete
   - Click on "🎯 Opportunities" tab
   - See detailed opportunity cards

## 🎯 What You'll See

### Opportunity Cards Show:
- **Ticker Symbol** (e.g., BRK.B)
- **Type** (Value, Flow, Insider, etc.)
- **Entry Reason** (e.g., "Margin of safety: 25.0%")
- **Upside Potential** (e.g., 35.0%)
- **Confidence Level** (e.g., 80.0%)
- **Time Horizon** (e.g., "12-18 months")

### Real-time Progress Shows:
- Current stage (e.g., "Running DCF models")
- Progress percentage
- Detailed stage history

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If opportunities don't appear:
1. ✅ Confirm you're in `/Users/davidwestera/trading-intelligence-system`
2. ✅ Run value analysis with multiple symbols
3. ✅ Wait for job to complete (status shows "completed")
4. ✅ Check "Opportunities" tab (not Dashboard tab)
5. ✅ Look in job history for detailed results

### If dashboard won't start:
1. ✅ Run `pwd` and confirm directory
2. ✅ Run `ls streamlit_enhanced.py` to confirm file exists
3. ✅ Try: `python launch_dashboard.py` for guided setup

## 🧪 Quick Test

To verify everything works:
```bash
cd /Users/davidwestera/trading-intelligence-system
python test_opportunity_flow.py
```

This should show opportunities being generated by agents.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Value Analysis** generates the most detailed opportunities
2. **Money Flows** shows institutional flow opportunities  
3. **Insider Analysis** reveals unusual activity opportunities
4. Use **job history filtering** to find specific analyses
5. **Real-time logs** show what's happening during analysis

**The opportunities ARE being generated - they just need to flow through the correct dashboard tabs! 🎯**
