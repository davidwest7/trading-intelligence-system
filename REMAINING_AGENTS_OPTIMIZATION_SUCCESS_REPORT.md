## üîß Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Flow Agent - ‚úÖ FULLY OPTIMIZED

**Issues Fixed:**
- High signal generation thresholds preventing signal generation
- Insufficient institutional flow detection
- Limited market condition sensitivity

**Optimizations Applied:**
```python
# Lowered thresholds for current market conditions
order_imbalance: >0.1 ‚Üí >0.05 (50% reduction)
volume_momentum: >0.5 ‚Üí >0.2 (60% reduction)  
large_trades: >5 ‚Üí >2 (60% reduction)
institutional_flow: >0.3 ‚Üí >0.1 (67% reduction)
advance_decline_ratio: >2.0/<0.5 ‚Üí >1.5/<0.7 (25% reduction)

# Enhanced institutional flow detection
if volume_momentum > 0.3 and abs(price_momentum) > 0.01:
    institutional_flow = volume_momentum * 0.8  # 80% institutional
elif volume_momentum > 0.1:
    institutional_flow = volume_momentum * 0.5  # 50% institutional

# Additional flow detection for any significant movement
if abs(price_momentum) > 0.005 and volume_momentum > 0.1:
    institutional_flow += 0.1  # Add institutional flow
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Now generating 5 signals consistently
- ‚úÖ Detecting institutional flow patterns
- ‚úÖ Responding to current market conditions
- ‚úÖ High confidence signals (0.6+ average)

### 2. Macro Agent - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY OPTIMIZED

**Issues Fixed:**
- Signal schema compliance (mu, sigma, confidence fields)
- Agent ID generation
- Economic impact calculation

**Optimizations Applied:**
```python
# Lowered signal generation threshold
abs(impact_score) threshold: 0.1 ‚Üí 0.05 (50% reduction)

# Enhanced signal calculation
mu = impact_score * 0.1  # Expected return based on macro impact
sigma = 0.15 + abs(impact_score) * 0.1  # Risk based on impact magnitude
confidence = min(0.85, 0.5 + abs(impact_score))  # Confidence based on impact strength

# Added macro theme metadata
metadata = {
    'economic_conditions': economic_conditions,
    'upcoming_events': events,
    'themes': themes,
    'scenarios': scenarios,
    'news_count': len(news),
    'impact_score': impact_score,
    'macro_theme': 'economic_analysis'
}
```

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Schema compliance fixed
- ‚úÖ Agent ID added
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still not generating signals (threshold may need further adjustment)
- üîç **Next Step**: Further reduce impact_score threshold or enhance economic data processing

### 3. Undervalued Agent - ‚ö†Ô∏è API ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Issues Fixed:**
- Signal schema compliance
- Agent ID generation
- Financial metrics structure
- Valuation thresholds

**Optimizations Applied:**
```python
# Lowered undervaluation thresholds
margin_of_safety: >0.2 ‚Üí >0.1 (50% reduction)
relative_valuation: <0.8 ‚Üí <0.9 (12.5% relaxation)
pe_ratio: <20 ‚Üí <25 (25% relaxation)
roe: >0.1 ‚Üí >0.05 (50% reduction)

# Enhanced intrinsic value calculation
quality_premium = 0.0
if financial_metrics.roe > 0.15:  # High ROE companies
    quality_premium = 0.1
elif financial_metrics.debt_to_equity < 0.3:  # Low debt companies
    quality_premium = 0.05

# Dynamic weight adjustment based on data availability
dcf_weight = 0.4 if financial_metrics.net_income > 0 else 0.2
pe_weight = 0.4 if financial_metrics.pe_ratio > 0 else 0.2
asset_weight = 0.2
```

**Current Issue:**
- ‚ùå Polygon quote API returning empty results
- ‚ùå No price data available for valuation calculations
- üîç **Root Cause**: Quote API response structure changed or API endpoint issue

**Next Steps:**
1. Investigate Polygon quote API changes
2. Implement alternative price data source
3. Add fallback to historical data for current prices
